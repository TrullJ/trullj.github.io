<h1>Final Report for CSPB 3112: Learn to Build and Deploy a Microservices Web App</h1>

<p>During the semester, my primary goal was to learn new technologies that are being used extensively by companies today to build modern, microservices applications.
My research determined that the core technologies used for such a task are containers (commonly Docker containers) and Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment of the
containers.  One can deploy Kubernetes from scratch wtihin their own data center or leverage a fully managed Kubernetes instance by one of the public cloud providers.
 For this project, I chose to leverage a fully managed Kubernetes instance in AWS known as AWS Elastic Kubernetes Instance or EKS.  To focus on learning these new technologies,
I leveraged a programming language and WSGI server that I was already familiar:  Python and Flask.  The following are the learning goals I had for the semester and my attainment of 
those goals.</p>

<h2>Goal 1 â€“ Complete CloudAcademy Course: Introduction to Kubernetes</h2>

<p><b>STATUS:  ACHIEVED</b></p><br>

<p>I completed the Introduction to Kubernetes course on CloudAcademy and achieved a score of 100% on the final exam. I learned that Kubernetes is ideal for managing
microservices because it can orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of each microservice individually.  Labs allowed me to gain experience with each of the
core components of Kubernetes:  Cluster, Node, Pod, Service, Deployment, ConfigMap, and Secret.</p>

<h2>Goal 2 - Complete CloudAcademy Course: Docker in Depth</h2>

<p><b>STATUS:  ACHIEVED</b></p><br>

<p>I completed the Docker in Depth course on CloudAcademy and achieved a score of 92% on the final exam.  I learned that Docker is a container technology that is
widely used today and ideal for creating containers that would comprise my microservices web application.  Labs and training videos allowed me to learn about
Linux isolation and container basics, Docker container components, Docker networking and storage, and creating Docker images using Dockerfiles.</p>
