<h3>Week 2 Update</h3>

<p>What did I accomplish this week?

This week I primarily focused on getting my Github website up and running and enrolling in the following CloudAcademy courses:  Introduction to Kubernetes, Introduction to Containers, Docker in Depth, and Python based Microservices - Go from Zero to Hero.  Continued work on my project proposal as well.

What is planned for next week?

Next week I plan to complete Intro to Containers and Docker in Depth, including building containers for my app.  Also, I plan to finalize my proposal for the course. 

What went well in the process/plan for the week?

I was excited to find online courses and labs to help me learn the new technologies I've selected for the hands-portion of the project.  I was also glad to see that I can use Python and Flask to develop microservices which I have familiarity with and am somewhat proficient.

What are some ideas for improvement in your process?

Need to ensure I begin the work earlier in the week.  I've also figured out that I need to sequence the courses so that it aligns with what I'm building.</p>
