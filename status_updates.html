<h3>Week 2 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
This week I primarily focused on getting my Github website up and running and enrolling in the following CloudAcademy courses:  Introduction to Kubernetes, Introduction to Containers, Docker in Depth, and Python based Microservices - Go from Zero to Hero.  Continued work on my project proposal as well.

<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

Next week I plan to complete Intro to Containers and Docker in Depth, including building containers for my app.  Also, I plan to finalize my proposal for the course. 

<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>
  
I was excited to find online courses and labs to help me learn the new technologies I've selected for the hands-portion of the project.  I was also glad to see that I can use Python and Flask to develop microservices which I have familiarity with and am somewhat proficient.

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
Need to ensure I begin the work earlier in the week.  I've also figured out that I need to sequence the courses so that it aligns with what I'm building.

<h3>Week 3 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
I completed the Intro to Docker Containers course on CloudAcademy and set-up docker desktop and deployed my first container.
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

Next week I plan on learning how to work with Docker Compose to manage applications and have an initial design and architecture for the micro-services application I intend to build during the term.
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>
  
I found it easier than anticipated to build and deploy my first Docker container.  The container images are also extremely lightweight which keeps them small and focused on the task at hand.
  
<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
I need to block more time early in the day when I'm fresh to focus on the more difficult tasks.  Other than time, the rest of the process is working well.

<h3>Week 4 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
This week I set-up an AWS account to use for the project and configured my IDE and file structure to begin building the microservices app.
I was also able to complete the Docker in Depth ourse and began work on Python and Flask Microservices course.  
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

Next week I plan on the Kubernetes course and spend time getting familiar with AWS EKS.
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>

The courses include labs which really cement the knowledge you gain by work with containers and Kubernetes.

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
Blocking time has helped for sure.  I need to spend more time architecting the microservices and documentating the interfaces before starting to write the code.
</p>

<h3>Week 5 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
<p>This week I primarily focused on building the first microservice to check the maliciousness of an email.  I completed about
  60% of the work.  I also spent time getting familiar with the AWS container ecosystem.</p>
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

<p>Next week, I plan to complete the coding on the email validity microservice and create test cases for it.</p>
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>

<p>The coding was fairly straightforward so I was happy with the speed at which I was able to get something functional working.</p>

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
<p>While I am familiar with Flask, I did need to refresh my understanding of the architecture.  Need to build in time for research even if I have previous experience with the technology.</p>
