<h3>Week 2 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
This week I primarily focused on getting my Github website up and running and enrolling in the following CloudAcademy courses:  Introduction to Kubernetes, Introduction to Containers, Docker in Depth, and Python based Microservices - Go from Zero to Hero.  Continued work on my project proposal as well.

<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

Next week I plan to complete Intro to Containers and Docker in Depth, including building containers for my app.  Also, I plan to finalize my proposal for the course. 

<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>
  
I was excited to find online courses and labs to help me learn the new technologies I've selected for the hands-portion of the project.  I was also glad to see that I can use Python and Flask to develop microservices which I have familiarity with and am somewhat proficient.

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
Need to ensure I begin the work earlier in the week.  I've also figured out that I need to sequence the courses so that it aligns with what I'm building.

<h3>Week 3 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
I completed the Intro to Docker Containers course on CloudAcademy and set-up docker desktop and deployed my first container.
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

Next week I plan on learning how to work with Docker Compose to manage applications and have an initial design and architecture for the micro-services application I intend to build during the term.
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>
  
I found it easier than anticipated to build and deploy my first Docker container.  The container images are also extremely lightweight which keeps them small and focused on the task at hand.
  
<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
I need to block more time early in the day when I'm fresh to focus on the more difficult tasks.  Other than time, the rest of the process is working well.
</p>

<h3>Week 4 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
This week I set-up an AWS account to use for the project and configured my IDE and file structure to begin building the microservices app.
I was also able to complete the Docker in Depth ourse and began work on Python and Flask Microservices course.  
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

Next week I plan on the Kubernetes course and spend time getting familiar with AWS EKS.
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>

The courses include labs which really cement the knowledge you gain by work with containers and Kubernetes.

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
Blocking time has helped for sure.  I need to spend more time architecting the microservices and documentating the interfaces before starting to write the code.
</p>

<h3>Week 5 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>
<p>This week I primarily focused on building the first microservice to check the maliciousness of an email.  I completed about
  60% of the work.  I also spent time getting familiar with the AWS container ecosystem.</p>
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

<p>Next week, I plan to complete the coding on the email validity microservice and create test cases for it.</p>
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>

<p>The coding was fairly straightforward so I was happy with the speed at which I was able to get something functional working.</p>

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
<p>While I am familiar with Flask, I did need to refresh my understanding of the architecture.  Need to build in time for research even if I have previous experience with the technology.</p>

<h3>Week 6 Update</h3>

<p>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>

<p>Good week in terms of getting part of the solution up and working.  Completed building the emailvalidator microservice
and converted the Flask app into a docker file.  Deployed and ran container locally and tested that it works.</p>
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

<p>Next week, I plan to begin building the file validation microservice and to deploy the emailvalidator microservice into AWS.</p>
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?
</h4>

<p>The process seems to be working which starts with completing training on the new technology and then spending time using it.</p>

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
</h4>
  
<p>It took longer than I anticipated to get the app to work in docker.  Main issue was understanding how to bind microservices to a port using both Flaska and docker.</p>

<h3>Week 7 Update</h3>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>

<p>I began work on a second container that will be used to call a third-party API to validate whether a file or URL is malicious.
I registered for an API key and began constructing the Flask microservice</p>
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

<p>Next week, I plan to finalize the build of the fileValidator microservice, deploy it in AWS, and test it.</p>
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?</h4>

<p>The development of the second microservice is going much faster as the coding patterns are identical to the first microservice.</p>

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>
  
<p>I did need to change the order in which I developed the app.  I was going to begin work on the frontend web app this week.  However,
it made more sense to get the backend microservices working first as they are decoupled from eachother and the frontend.  As such,
the project plan is being updated to reflect that the frontend will be built last after the three backend microservices are completed.</p>

<h3>Week 8 Update</h3>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>

<p>I completed the work for the second Microservice.  I ended up breaking up the capability into two separate microservices.
One for validating the suspiciousness of a URL and one for doing the same for files.  I thought this was best as the end
user will likely only submit a URL or file for analysis, not both, and thus good to decouple the services.</p>
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

<p>Next week, I plan to begin working on the SSL validator microservice.</p>
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?</h4>

<p>Development speed continues to accelerate as much of the code is similar.</p>

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>
  
<p>No significant improvements identified this week.</p>

<h3>Week 9 Update</h3>
  
<h4>What did I accomplish this week?</h4>

<p>I completed an initial build of the frontend microservice.  The frontend service has one input box that can take
in a URL or email (as of now) and upon submission, calls a second microservice that calls APIs to collect information
on whether an eamil or URL is suspicious.  The worker microservices return the results back to the frontend.  I tested
the frontend and email microservices and was pleased that they communicated as expected and returned the proper results.</p>
  
<h4>What is planned for next week?</h4>

<p>Next week, I plan to complete the frontend component for routing calls to the URL validation microservice.</p>
  
<h4>What went well in the process/plan for the week?</h4>

<p>Development continues to move smoothly.  I did make one change to the plan.  Instead of building the SSL microservice, I 
instead focused on getting the frontend built and wired with the email Microservice to ensure the architecture works.  I felt
this change in schedule was needed so that I would not need to re-architect a design that might not work.</p>

<h4>What are some ideas for improvement in your process?</h4>
  
<p>I found it necessary to sketch out the architecture on paper first before beginning to write the code.  I found this to help
solidify the code I needed to write and is something I will use going forward.</p>
