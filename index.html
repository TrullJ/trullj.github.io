    <H1>CSPB 3112 Project: Learn to Build and Deploy a Microservices Web App</H1>
    <p>Website to track the professional development project associated with CSPB 3112.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <p>During the term of the course, I will build a microservices based web application leveraging Python and Flask.  
      The web app will be comprised of four Docker containers: frontend, emailValidator, fileValidator, and sslValidator.  
      The web app will allow a user on the Internet to test if an email, file and/or URL, or the PKI certificate associated with a website is a cybersecurity risk or suspicious.  
      The application will be hosted in AWS and the Docker containers will be managed using the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon EC2 worker nodes.  
      Each microservice will use APIs from other third-party services to provide the validation work.  
      The web app will make it seamless for users to test the suspiciousness of emails, files, and websites without visiting three different websites.</p>
    
    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>

    <p>My vision for this project is to learn how to effectively leverage several modern technologies that are being heavily used in the software development industry today.  
      These technologies include Docker containers, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.  
      Specifically, I want to gain enough knowledge and skills with these technologies to build, deploy, secure, and manage a basic microservices application using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon EC2 worker nodes.</p>

    <h2> Motivation </h2>

    <p>Cloud-native apps using a microservices architecture are becoming more and more popular, and Kubernetes has become the de facto container orchestration and management solution.  
      In fact, according to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, there are now over 5.6 million developers using Kubernetes.  
      I work as a cybersecurity professional and due to the popularity of these technologies; it is essential that I understand how these solutions work, including how to properly configure and architect them to ensure they are built securely.</p>

<h2>Risks to Project Completion </h2>

<p>The primary risks to completing the project are the following:
1.	Time management – The primary risk to the project is ensuring that I set aside sufficient, high-quality time to complete the courses and build the microservices application.  

2.	Building and managing cloud native apps requires the use of several technologies – Unlike learning a new programming language, building and deploying a cloud native, microservices app requires one to learn containers, Kubernetes, microservices architecture, and how to leverage at least one of the primary cloud services providers like AWS or Azure.  
  There is a risk in my ability to master these technologies sufficiently to build and deploy the proposed web app and get them sufficiently configured and integrated to work properly.
</p>
    
<h2>Risk Mitigation Strategy</h2> 

<p>To mitigate the risks to the project, I have blocked an hour each day on my calendar to focus on completing the project milestones.  
  Equally, I chose Python and Flask to build the microservices both of which I have significant experience.  
  This will allow me to be efficient in writing the application, prevent me from learning a new programming language and framework, and therefore focus most of my time learning the new technologies that are required to deploy and manage the app in AWS.  
  These mitigation strategies should help me complete the project on time.h</p>
